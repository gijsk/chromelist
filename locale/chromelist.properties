replace.dataurl               = Sorry, this item has been overridden with a data: URI. This means it can't be replaced at runtime. In order to replace it, edit the associated manifest file (you can copy the path of said manifest file from the properties window).

problem.override.notApplied       = Trying to override %S with the file at %S, but as far as Chrome List can tell it didn't work (the Chrome Service is reporting a different URL for the URL you're overriding).
problem.override.pathDoesNotExist = Trying to override %S with the file at %S, but the latter does not exist.
problem.override.unrecognized.url = Trying to override %S with the file at %S, but it's not a local URL. This means the chrome protocol handler will stop you from being able to use it.
problem.override.isDir            = Trying to override %S with the directory at %S, but overriding directories is useless.
problem.override.noJarFile        = Trying to override %S with the jar at %S, but the latter does not exist.
problem.override.fileNotInJar     = Trying to override %S with the file at %S, but that path doesn't exist in the jar.
problem.override.jarFailure       = Trying to override %S with the file at %S, but failed to read the jar URI due to an exception: %S.

error.no.url.for.file             = Couldn't get the URL for this file... sorry!

# New problem msgs:
problem.unrecognized.url          = Trying to map %S to %S, but apparently this is not a local file. Please make sure this is the case, as privileging remote code is bad.
problem.convertChromeURL.failure  = Trying to find the files in chrome package %S, but the Chrome Service does not like this URL. This may mean the current application fails an application or version check, or that the URL you gave to the contents of this package was not parseable. Check your syntax carefully.
problem.noFile                    = Trying to map %S to %S, but that path does not exist.
problem.noJarFile                 = Trying to map %S to something in the jar file at %S, but that jarfile does not exist.
problem.fileNotInJar              = Trying to map %S to %S, but this path does not exist in the jarfile. Please check your zipping procedures for this jarfile carefully.
problem.mappedToFile              = Trying to map %S to %S, but that is a file, not a directory.
problem.mappedToEmptyDir          = Trying to map %S to the directory %S, but this directory is empty. This may be intentional, just letting you know!
